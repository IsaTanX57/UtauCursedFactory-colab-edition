A tool for creating full minimal Utau VoiceBanks with only 6 voice clips

## How to use
Its usage is pretty simple: Go to the "vowels" folder and replace all the 6 audios with your own.

After you've done that open the program and press Enter. If you use Windows you'll most likely hear a preview of your VB (AKA. hell).

When it's finished just close the program and move the "result" folder to your utau installation and give it a name.
