A tool for creating full minimal Utau VoiceBanks with only 6 voice clips

### About Windows Defender
Windows Defender and other antiviruses currently detect PyInstaller exes as viruses. If you ARE affected by this you can always whitelist the program.

## How to use
Its usage is pretty simple: Go to the "vowels" folder and replace all the 6 audios with your own.

After you've done that open the program and press Enter. If you use Windows you'll most likely hear a preview of your VB (AKA. hell).

When it's finished just close the program and move the "result" folder to your utau installation and give it a name.

## Tips on how to use it well

If you want to make your voicebank actually sound good you must look at the vowel's soundwaves.
